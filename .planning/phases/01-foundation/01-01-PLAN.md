  <name>Task 1: Add profile tab and update tab layout</name>
  <files>
    app/(tabs)/profile.tsx
    app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    1. Create `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`:
       - Export default function ProfileScreen
       - Display placeholder content with SafeAreaView
       - Show "Profile" text centered on screen
       - Use existing ThemedText and ThemedView components for consistency

    2. Update `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`:
       - Add third Tabs.Screen for "profile"
       - Use IconSymbol with "person.fill" icon (SF Symbol name)
       - Title: "Profile"
       - Keep existing home and explore tabs
       - Change explore icon from "paperplane.fill" to "compass" for better semantics

    Icons to use (SF Symbols):
    - Home: "house.fill" (already exists)
    - Explore: "compass" (change from paperplane.fill)
    - Profile: "person.fill" (add new)

    Note: The existing template uses IconSymbol which works with SF Symbols on iOS and falls back on other platforms.

    Run `npx expo start` and verify in simulator:
    - Three tabs visible at bottom (Home, Explore, Profile)
    - Tapping each tab shows different content
    - Icons display correctly
    - Active tab is highlighted
  </verify>
  <done>
    App shows three tabs with correct icons; tapping each navigates to its screen.
  </done>
</task>

  <name>Task 2: Clean up tab screens with placeholder content</name>
  <files>
    app/(tabs)/index.tsx
    app/(tabs)/explore.tsx
    app/(tabs)/profile.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Clean up all three tab screens to have consistent, minimal placeholder content:

    1. `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` (Home):
       - Remove demo content (ParallaxScrollView, HelloWave, etc.)
       - Replace with simple centered layout: SafeAreaView with ThemedView
       - Show "Home" as title and "Your feed will appear here" as subtitle
       - Keep it simple - just proving navigation works

    2. `app/(tabs)/explore.tsx` (Explore):
       - Remove demo content (Collapsible sections)
       - Replace with simple centered layout
       - Show "Explore" as title and "Discover verses from the community" as subtitle

    3. `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` (Profile):
       - Ensure consistent styling with other tabs
       - Show "Profile" as title and "Your profile details" as subtitle

    Styling approach:
    - Use flex: 1 with alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center'
    - Use ThemedText for text (respects color scheme)
    - Use ThemedView as container (respects background color)
    - Remove all demo/template content - these are placeholders

    This creates clean slate screens ready for actual features in later phases.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run app and navigate through all tabs:
    - Home shows centered placeholder
    - Explore shows centered placeholder
    - Profile shows centered placeholder
    - All screens use theme-aware colors (light/dark)
    - No demo content remains (no collapsibles, no parallax, no wave emoji)
  </verify>
  <done>
    All three tab screens show clean, centered placeholder content with consistent styling.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

After all tasks complete:

1. `npx expo start --ios` - App launches in iOS simulator
2. Three tabs visible: Home (house icon), Explore (compass icon), Profile (person icon)
3. Each tab navigates to its respective screen
4. Screens show simple placeholder text, no demo content
5. Dark mode toggle (if available on device) changes colors appropriately
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- App launches with tab-based navigation (home, explore, profile tabs visible)
- Tapping each tab navigates to correct screen
- Tab bar icons are visually clear and appropriate
- Active tab is distinguishable from inactive tabs
- No demo/template content remains on any tab screen
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-foundation/01-01-SUMMARY.md`
