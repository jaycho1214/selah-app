<objective>
Convert the existing single-feed Posts screen into a dual-tab feed with swipeable For You and Following sub-tabs using PagerView.

Purpose: Per user decision, the Posts tab must have two nested sub-tabs (For You showing all verse posts, Following showing posts from followed users) with Twitter/X style tab labels and swipe navigation. Each tab has independent scroll position and pagination state.

Output: Rewritten posts.tsx with PagerView dual-tab layout, custom animated tab bar header, and a Zustand store for feed tab state.

  <name>Task 1: Create feed store and rewrite Posts screen with dual-tab PagerView</name>
  <files>lib/stores/feed-store.ts, app/(tabs)/posts.tsx</files>
  <action>
**Feed Store (lib/stores/feed-store.ts):**

Create a minimal Zustand store for feed tab state:
```typescript
import { create } from 'zustand';

interface FeedStore {
  activeTab: number;  // 0 = For You, 1 = Following
  setActiveTab: (tab: number) => void;
}

export const useFeedStore = create<FeedStore>()((set) => ({
  activeTab: 0,
  setActiveTab: (tab) => set({ activeTab: tab }),
}));
```

**Posts Screen (app/(tabs)/posts.tsx):**

Completely rewrite posts.tsx with the dual-tab PagerView structure:

1. **Custom Tab Bar Header:**
   - Positioned at the top of the screen, below the safe area inset
   - Two tab labels: "For You" and "Following" -- centered horizontally
   - Active tab label: bold text, primary color. Inactive: muted color
   - Animated underline indicator that slides between tabs using `useAnimatedStyle` with `withTiming`
   - Tab labels are `Pressable` -- tapping switches the tab via `pagerViewRef.current?.setPage(index)`
   - No app logo, no header bar -- just the two labels (per user decision: minimal and clean)
   - Background color matches the screen bg, with a subtle bottom border

2. **PagerView Setup:**
   - `PagerView` with `ref` for programmatic page changes
   - `initialPage={useFeedStore.getState().activeTab}` (restore last tab)
   - `onPageSelected` callback: update `useFeedStore` activeTab AND update animated indicator
   - CRITICAL: Guard against setPage -> onPageSelected infinite loop by comparing values before calling setPage
   - Two children pages, each with `style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }}` (NOT flex: 1 -- PagerView requirement)
   - Each child needs `collapsable={false}` for Android

3. **For You Feed (Page 0):**
   - Wrap in `Suspense` with `FeedSkeleton` as fallback
   - Inner component `ForYouFeed` uses `useLazyLoadQuery` + `usePaginationFragment` with the existing `bibleVersePosts` query (same GraphQL as current posts.tsx)
   - Uses connection key `"forYouFeed_bibleVersePosts"` (distinct from Following)
   - Renders via `FeedList` component from Plan 01
   - Mutation handlers (like, unlike, delete) with optimistic updates -- same logic as current posts.tsx
   - Pull-to-refresh via `refetch` with `store-and-network` policy
   - Empty state: existing empty card with "No posts yet" message

4. **Following Feed (Page 1):**
   - Wrap in `Suspense` with `FeedSkeleton` as fallback
   - Inner component `FollowingFeed`:
     - Check if user is authenticated via `useSession()`
     - If NOT authenticated: show empty state with "Sign in to see posts from people you follow" + sign-in button
     - If authenticated: attempt to use a `bibleVersePosts` query with a `following: true` filter parameter
     - IMPORTANT: The backend may not support a "following" filter yet. If the query fails or doesn't exist, show a graceful empty state: "Following feed coming soon"
     - For the optimistic approach: try using the same `bibleVersePosts` query but check if the server supports a filter argument. If not, just show the empty state for now.
   - Following feed empty state (per user decision):
     - Friendly illustration area (use a large Users icon from lucide at 48px in a rounded container with accent background)
     - Text: "Follow people to see their posts here"
     - Button/link: "Discover posts" that switches to For You tab via `pagerViewRef.current?.setPage(0)`

5. **GraphQL fragments:**
   - For You: Keep the same fragment structure as current posts.tsx but with connection key `"forYouFeed_bibleVersePosts"`
   - Following: Create a separate fragment with connection key `"followingFeed_bibleVersePosts"` (even if it uses the same query for now)
   - Both fragments must select the same fields as the current posts.tsx (id, content, createdAt, likesCount, childPostsCount, likedAt, user{...}, images{...}, poll{...}, verse{...})

6. **Content insets:**
   - `contentContainerStyle={{ paddingTop: TAB_BAR_HEIGHT + insets.top, paddingBottom: insets.bottom + 100 }}`
   - Tab bar is absolute positioned at the top with a semi-transparent background + blur effect (or solid bg color)

Run `npx relay-compiler` after creating the GraphQL fragments to generate types.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npx relay-compiler` -- should complete without errors.
Run `npx tsc --noEmit` -- should compile without type errors.
Run `npx expo start` and verify the Posts tab shows two sub-tabs that can be swiped and tapped.
  </verify>
  <done>
Posts screen shows For You and Following sub-tabs with:
- Swipeable PagerView navigation between tabs
- Tappable tab labels with animated underline indicator
- For You tab loads all verse posts with pagination and pull-to-refresh
- Following tab shows appropriate empty state (sign-in prompt or "follow people" CTA)
- Skeleton cards show during initial load (not a spinner)
- Each tab preserves scroll position when switching
- Feed tab state persists in Zustand store
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npx relay-compiler` passes
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
- Posts tab shows "For You" and "Following" labels at top
- Swiping left/right switches between tabs
- Tapping a label switches to that tab
- Animated underline moves with tab selection
- For You tab shows posts with infinite scroll and pull-to-refresh
- Following tab shows empty state with CTA
- Skeleton cards appear during initial load
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Dual-tab feed is fully navigable via swipe and tap
- For You feed preserves all existing functionality (pagination, like/unlike, delete, pull-to-refresh)
- Following feed shows meaningful empty state with navigation to For You
- No regression in post interaction features
- TypeScript and Relay compilation pass
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-feed-engagement/05-02-SUMMARY.md`
